exp 1 image resizing
Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image.
exp.2 image rotaion
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
exp.3 image traslation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
exp.4 image shearing
The shearing parameters are specified in the transformation matrix as the shearX shearY elements. The shearX element specifies the amount of shearing in the x-axis, while the shearY element specifies the amount of shearing in the y-axis
exp.5 image normalization
Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing algorithms, as many algorithms work better when the pixel values are within a certain range.
exp.6 image edge detection
The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in the context of image recognition or object localization/detection. There are several algorithms for detecting edges due to its wide applicability.
exp.7 image blurring
Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood. This can be done to reduce noise, soften edges, or make it harder to identify a picture. In many image processing tasks, image blurring is a common preprocessing step. It is useful in the optimization of algorithms such as image classification, object identification, and image segmentation. In OpenCV, a variety of different blurring methods are available, each with a particular trade-off between blurring strength and speed.
exp.8 morphological image processing
Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image. These procedures are commonly used to eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images.
